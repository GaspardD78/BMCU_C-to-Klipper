# 📂 BMCU-C Firmware v0020

## Folder overview

This folder regroups the **v0020 universal firmware** for **all BMCU-C boards**, including the upcoming dual microswitch Hall sensor version. These archives were moved to the top-level `firmware/` directory to simplify navigation and avoid redundant nesting from previous releases.

> 🔧 "**Universal**" means it works across all A1/P1/X1 printers, as long as you’re using a **370 motor and Hall-based buffer**.  
> The choice of sub-board does not matter; for P1, just ensure the pipe length is configured correctly to choose **internal** or **external** version.  
> A1 is configured as internal by default and does not require adjustment.

## 🔤 Firmware Naming (A/B/C/D)

The files named `BMCU-C-0020-P-X-Series-Int/Ext-Hub-A/B/C/D` are specifically for **P1 series**:

- Choose `Int` or `Ext` version according to your Hub location.
- The suffix `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` determines the printer’s ability to recognize up to 4 devices.
- For A1, you can **directly flash `BMCU-C-0020-A Series Printer.bin`** without concern.

## 🏷️ Firmware aliases for the setup script

The deployment script exposes each firmware through a stable slugified alias. These aliases are
generated by lowercasing the firmware stem and replacing non-alphanumeric characters with dashes.
If you ever need to customize them, update the table below — it is parsed at runtime to override
the default slugs.

<!-- firmware-aliases:start -->
| Alias | Fichier |
|-------|---------|
| `bmcu-c-0020-a-series-printer` | `BMCU-C-0020-A Series Printer.bin` |

## 🔧 Practical Examples

Here are some common usage scenarios and the corresponding firmware to flash:

- 🟢 **For A1 mini**:  
  Flash `BMCU-C-0020-A Series Printer.bin`

- 🟢 **For A1**:  
  Flash `BMCU-C-0020-A Series Printer.bin`

- 🟢 **For P1S using a single BMCU with external 5-way hub**:  
  Flash `BMCU-C-0020-P-X-Series-Ext-Hub-A.bin`

- 🟢 **For P1S using two BMCUs with external 5-way hubs**:  
  - Flash `BMCU-C-0020-P-X-Series-Ext-Hub-A.bin` on BMCU #1  
  - Flash `BMCU-C-0020-P-X-Series-Ext-Hub-B.bin` on BMCU #2


## 🗓️ Firmware Update – July 25, 2025 (v0020)

**BMCU-C v0020 Changelog:**

- 🛠️ Fixed incorrect LED behavior where some statuses failed to light up
- ⚙️ Resolved issue with unexpected channel online status
- 🔧 Corrected anti-disconnection mechanism (previously ineffective)
- 💡 Completely reworked the LED system:
  - Fixed flickering issues
  - Reduced LED refresh rate to improve performance
- 🔁 When a channel error is detected, the system now retries lighting up the red LED every 3 seconds.  
  This ensures that channels inserted **after** the BMCU has entered working state will still be detected visually.


**BMCU-C v0019 Changelog:**

- ✅ **16-color support** for P1/X1 printers (requires flashing the new firmware)
- 🛠️ Fixed the issue where **filament info could not be saved** on the latest P1 firmware (`00.01.06.62`) and slicing software (`2.1.1.52`)
- ⚙️ Refined online channel logic to prevent incorrect status detection in edge cases
- ⚡ Improved motor control: separate logic for high and low voltage scenarios

## 💡 Changes Compared to Previous v0013 (Anti-Overheat Light Optimization)

- 🌙 Mainboard LED Behavior:
  - Red breathing light when not connected to printer
  - White breathing light when working normally
- 🔅 Further reduced LED brightness for buffer and mainboard to prevent overheating
- 🔁 Ejection behavior revised: removed A1-specific retraction control for broader compatibility
